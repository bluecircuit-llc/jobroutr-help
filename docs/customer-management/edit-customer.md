# Editing a Customer

This guide walks you through the process of editing existing customer information, managing service locations, updating service overrides, and modifying assets like pools.

## Step 4: Update Service Location Details

When editing a service location, you can modify:

- **Name**: The descriptive name for this location
- **Sub-Customer**: Toggle this option to determine if a separate customer will be created in QuickBooks Online
- **Bill with Parent**: When enabled along with Sub-Customer, invoices for this location will be combined with the parent customer's billing
- **Same as Billing Address**: Toggle this to automatically use the customer's billing address as the service location address
- **Service Location Address**: The physical address where services are performed
- **Pet Name**: If applicable, the name of any pets at the location
- **Note**: Any special instructions or notes for this location

:::info QuickBooks Integration
Only **one non-subcustomer address** can be created per customer. This address will be stored as the shipping address in QuickBooks Online. All other service locations must be marked as sub-customers.

After making changes, click **Save** to update the service location.

## Step 5: Manage Service Overrides

Service overrides allow you to set location-specific pricing and costs for services. In the **Services** section of the service location, you can:

- **Add Service**: Click to add a new service override
- **Edit**: Modify an existing service override
- **Delete**: Remove a service override

Service overrides are useful when you have negotiated special rates or need custom pricing for specific locations.

When editing a service override, you can customize:

- **Price**: The customer-facing price for this service at this location
- **Price Type**: How the price is calculated (e.g., Per Stop, Per Hour, Flat Rate)
- **Labor Cost**: Your internal cost for labor
- **Labor Cost Type**: How the labor cost is calculated

Click **Save** to apply the service override changes.

Each service location can have multiple pools associated with it.
