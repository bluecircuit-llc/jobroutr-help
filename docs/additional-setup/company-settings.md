### Using Addresses for Route Optimization

Once you've added organization addresses, you can use them as:

- **Starting points** for technician routes
- **Ending points** for technician routes

This helps optimize travel time and ensures efficient scheduling when planning daily routes for your field technicians.

## Best Practices

### Address Management
- Keep your addresses up to date to ensure accurate route optimization
- Use clear, descriptive names for each address

### Route Optimization
- Add all common starting locations for your technicians
- Consider adding warehouse or supply depot locations
- Keep addresses current if locations change

### Billing Information
- Ensure your billing address is accurate for invoicing purposes
- Update your phone number so you can be reached for important notifications
- Review and save changes after any updates

## Tips

- **Multiple Locations**: If you operate from multiple locations, add each one as a separate organization address
- **Mobile Technicians**: For technicians who work from home, you can add an address near them as organization addresses.
- **Descriptive Names**: Use names that clearly identify the purpose or location, such as "Main Office - Downtown" or "Service Center - North"
